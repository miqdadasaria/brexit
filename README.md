# Brexit Prediction Model

This is a basic R brexit referendum prediction model with a number of input parameters that can be varied to reflect alternative assumptions.

Predictions are based on the FT poll of polls: https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/

To run the stand alone R code use file standalone.R

To run the shiny app from R you must have the shiny package installed and run the following command from the R console: shiny::runGitHub('brexit', 'miqdadasaria')

Alternatively a running example can be found at the following address: https://miqdadasaria.shinyapps.io/brexit/
